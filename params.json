Clients connect to a server using sockets to transfer data you therefore have to specifiy the IP address of the computer the server is running on (all programs can run on the same computer using localhost as the server address). There is a json config file which can be edited with a text editor to customise how the program runs.\r\n\r\nFile Structure\r\n------\r\nFile|Ussage\r\n----|------\r\nmain.py|Main menu which allows running of all other programs through a gui\r\nweakest_link/server.py|Server file which runs the gamecode and controls client programs\r\nweakest_link/control.py|Connects to server as a client and controls gameflow\r\nweakest_link/gui.py|Connects to the server as a client and displays the game stats\r\nweakest_link/network.py|Networking API wraping socket libary\r\nweakest_link/misc.py|Miscellaneous API containting mostly file related functions \r\n\r\nReleases\r\n---\r\nhttps://github.com/william1616/WeakestLink/releases\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
